## About

[Toastmasters International](http://www.toastmasters.org) is, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toastmasters):

I'm a member of the [Palo Alto Early Risers](http://2117.toastmastersclubs.org) club. I'm doing this to improve my public speaking skills for conferences. And so far I have to say, it's working.
