# [fit] talent
## [fit] the pernicious myth

^ Talent! It's a word I hear a lot.

---

# [fit] "She's such a
# [fit] *talented*
# [fit] programmer."

^ Or "looking for talented full-stack engineers; must be rock star ninjas."

---

# [fit] He's such a
# [fit] *talented*
# [fit] ballet dancer.

^ You've heard this. So-and-so is talented and amazing and does things other people marvel at. Talent! It's a thing people have! I'm not sure how they get it, but woo, that guy sure has it. I wonder what it is.

---

# [fit] midichlorians

^ Maybe talent is midichlorians. You remember, the stuff in your blood that made you a Jedi. It's just like royal blood!

## [fit] He's got 'em. We don't.

^ The implication is, don't even bother if you have these talent dinguses in your blood. You either have it or not. There is no try. I don't buy it.

---

# [fit] Nobody is born
# [fit] knowing how to program.

^ or dance ballet or fight with a lightsaber. These are learned skills. This implies that somewhere between the time when that "talented developer" was a baby & when she took that rock star ninja full stack job, she learned how to program.

---

# [fit] We see an
# [fit] endpoint

^ What you see is the endpoint: the seemingly effortless display of skill. We call that "talent". This term does us a terrible disservice, however, because "talent" is a static word. Skill is not static, though. It's a state of being, an ongoing process. Something you construct.

---

# [fit] Let's reframe
# [fit] "talent"

^ Let's reframe it into something more constructive. Let's reconstruct talent into a way of thinking, not a gene.

---

# [fit] Talent ==
# [fit] obsession +
# [fit] opportunity


^ What do I mean by this? Let's look at those two pieces.

---

# [fit] Obsession

^ Handy word to cover motivation. And not just any motivation-- we're talking about being *driven*. I'd really like to ski jump, but not enough to go find a mountain with one of those ramp things and *do* it even once, never mind enough times to not fall on my face.

---

# [fit] Interest
# [fit] Drive

^ Two other words for this feeling. This is the level of motivation that makes you skip doing other things because you are just *so* fascinated by this one thing. For us here in this room, it's probably programming computers.

---

# [fit] Opportunity

^ Access to resources. Doesn't do much good if you're obsessed with playing the guitar if you don't have one to play. Or you have a guitar but no instruction. Or if you lock yourself in the bedroom with a Les Paul and a stack of blues records, but you're a girl & get made fun of.

---

# [fit] case study
# [fit] Michael Phelps

^ Let me show you an example. Michael Phelps.

---

![](http://footballmentaltoughness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/michael-phelps-fly.jpg)


^ This guy. Olympic medalist. A talented swimmer, right? He must be! And Phelps *does* have some genetic advantages that help him swimming. He has a freakishly huge wingspan. You know what else he has?

---

# [fit] Coaching.
# [fit] a pool.
# [fit] parents.

^ Access to a swimming pool when he was a kid. Coaching to help him learn how to swim. Time to swim. Parents who supported him.

---

# [fit] opportunity

^ Money. Privilege. For every Phelps with his long arms, there are a thousand other kids out there with the same build who never got a chance to learn how to swim. Are they just not *talented*? Or do they have less privilege?

---

# [fit] phelps is
# [fit] obsessed

^ He cares enough about swimming to devote the hours of training & practice. For every Phelps winning medals, there are a thousand young people who have the basic body type, have a pool, have doting parents, but hate swimming. They want to be guitarists instead. Are they just not *talented?* Or are they uninterested?

---

# [fit] Here's the kicker.

^ That freakishly large wingspan? Turns out you can modify your bone density by exercising a lot when you're an adolescent. Phelps has those arms partly because he was using them a ton when he was a teenager.

---

# [fit] midichlorians
# [fit] are myth.

---

# [fit] We are malleable.

^ You are malleable. Your body is malleable. Your brain is malleable. Want an real-world example?

---

![](file:///Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/toastmasters/08/loaded_barbell.jpeg)

^ I lifted this yesterday morning. 335 pounds. Am I a talented weightlifter? No. I started by picking up the empty bar. And I repeated that. I loved doing it, so I did even more. Want to know what I'm even more obsessed with?

---

![](file:///Users/ceej/Dropbox/projects/toastmasters/08/obsession_charted.png)

^ Writing software. I write a lot of it, and some of it even works. But please don't call me talented.

---

# [fit] Why not say
# [fit] "talented"?

^ Because of what it does to my head. It locks me in place.

---

# [fit] Growth
# [fit] mindset.

^ You can change if you think you can change. If you think of your abilities as something you can modify, you will modify them.

---

# [fit] the 10x
# [fit] programmer

^ You've heard of this person, right? The mythical programmer who does the work of 10 other people. This is usually tied up with nonsense about 80 hour work weeks and other utter bunk, so people dismiss it. I don't. But I also don't think you should try to be 10x me, or 10x that other person on your team.

---

# [fit] Be 10x
# [fit] yourself.

^ You probably are 10x your beginner self already. The insight here is that you can continue growing. You can be that "talented" programmer. It's just a matter of working on your craft.

---

# [fit] Get obsessed.
# [fit] Make opportunities.

^ Whatever it is you're obsessed with, roll with it. Find teachers, find a support group, read books, practice. Work on your craft. Work on it until you too look "effortless".

---

# [fit] Flip it

---

# [fit] provide the
# [fit] opportunity
# [fit] to a newbie

^ Everybody needs that opportunity, that access to a good teacher, or materials, or equipment. You have something that somebody just starting out needs. Why not share it? Give a leg up to the people they'll be calling "talented" a decade from now.

---

# [fit] Talent ==
# [fit] obsession +
# [fit] opportunity

^ And this means you can have it too.
