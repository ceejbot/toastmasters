# The Five-Minute Religious Tract Sales Pitch

Good morning, fellow Toastmasters. Thank you for having me.

It's true. This isn't my first experience with training for public speaking. I started writing proposals for tech conference presentation recently, and my childhood experience came to mind. When I was a kid, every week I was in a class that taught public speaking skills. Did I remember enough of what I'd learned back then to help me now, as I stand in front of roomfuls of programmers with a big high-def projection behind me? It's relevant, right?

Except it's not. It turns out that practice selling religious tracts isn't so useful.

The first thing to know is that my parents were Jehovah's Witnesses. Those are the friendly people who knock on your door on Saturday mornings and try to sell you the Watchtower magazine. When I was a kid, I was one of those smiling people. Watchtower and Awake, ten cents. The Witnesses call this "witnessing", which tells you how important it is to them. So naturally they invest time in teaching their members how to do it. Every Thursday night, they get together for an hour for the "Theocratic Ministry School". My dad taught this school when I was little, which meant he had the title "school overseer". Of course I was a student in the school.

Every Thursday night, scheduled victims would get up and give their speeches, just like how we do it here at Toastmasters. Some talks were 20 minutes. Most were five. Each speaker would be working on the particular skill they'd been assigned, like "volume and pausing", "audience contact & use of notes", or "sense stress and modulation."

Imagine nervous little boys in their Sunday best on a Thursday night, with their clip-on ties doing their starter talks, usually easy Bible readings, working on "repetition & gestures." "And then Moses parted the Red Sea" [huge stilted gesture].

Sounds great! It was great. The skills this school taught were completely useful for everyday speaking. 

Here's the catch.

It was only the guys-- the "brothers"-- who were allowed to stand behind the podium and address the audience directly. The sisters -- and that included me-- were never allowed to teach the congregation. We had to write not speeches, but little skits with an assistant. These skits were supposed to use settings taken from a little list of "realistic" settings, where the speaker is teaching the "householder" about the Bible, or perhaps encouraging the other person to attend church.

I asked my mom once, "Why can't girls give regular talks?"

"Because that's the way it is."

"But why is it that way, mom?"

This shut me up when I was a kid, but that answer satisfied me less and less as I grew up. But I was a good kid, so I did the skits. My mom once asked me, during those sullen teen years, how I was so good at writing talks. I explained that they were miniature plays. Introduction, development of conflict, midpoint revelation, rising action to the climactic moment where the householder is convinced of the awesomeness of the religious tract, then fast denouement. That answer didn't make her very happy.

Writing short plays is a handy skill, and I've used it often, believe it or not. But it's not the same skill as standing up in front of an audience and addressing it directly. In these skits, you're looking at one other person, not a full audience. Delivering it is not oratory in any sense. It's more like acting. 

So when I considered everything I'd learned from the Theocratic Ministry School, I realized it was helpful in theory, but none of the practice was useful.

It's thirty years later. I'm trying to re-contextualize everything I learned back then for an entirely new stage. This time around I'm not going to be selling religious tracts. I'm going to be talking to audiences of nerds about programming and robots. And I'm going to learn how to face the audience and talk to you all directly.

Thank you.
