# How to get strong


## Why?

Yesterday I read a study that suggested that BMI is unrelated to health & long life. What *is* related is muscle mass. Pure muscle mass: more muscle, longer life.

This connects to another study I read on people in late middle age. They were measured on their ability to sit down on the floor & then get up without assistance. High scores on the test were directly correlated with low mortality rate.

In other words, if you don't have core strength, you're not going to live very long.

Reason 2: bone strength in women - stress bones to strengthen them & avoid osteoporosis

I'm convinced! What the heck do I do?

## Step 1: find a gym

Find a gym with barbells & big metal plates. Crossfits can work if you can ignore the crossfit part.

- Do free weights. Ignore stereotypes. Free weights allow you to do functional movements that work supporting muscles as well as the big ones.

Difference between running on a treadmill & running on a path.

## Step 2: Pick up weights & put them down again.

Compound lifts:

## The five lifts to do

The squat: the king of exercises.

The deadlift: pick a heavy thing off the floor.

The bench press: push a heavy thing away from you.

The overhead press: press something overhead.

The barbell row: pull something toward you.

A: squat / deadlift / bench press
B: squat / ohp  / row 

Dead simple program: 5 sets of 5 reps each. If you complete the sets, add 5 pounds the next time.


If you need to pick one of these exercises, do the squat. If you need to pick two, the squat & the deadlift. If you want to omit one, lose the bench press-- those are beach muscles, not practical muscles.
