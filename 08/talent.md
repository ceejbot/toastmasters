^ Take Michael Phelps. A talented swimmer, right? Won all those Olympic medals. And Phelps *does* have some genetic advantages that help him swimming. He has a freakishly huge wingspan. Midichlorians! You know what else he has?

# [fit] Coaching
# [fit] Access to a swimming pool

---

# [fit] phelps had
# [fit] opportunity

^ Money. Privilege. Access to a swimming pool when he was a kid. Coaching to help him learn how to swim. Parents who supported him.

^ For every Phelps with his long arms, there are a thousand other kids out there with the same build who never got a chance to learn how to swim. Are they just not *talented*?

# [fit] phelps is
# [fit] obsessed

^ He cares enough about swimming to devote the hours of training & practice.

---

# [fit] Why does this
# [fit] matter?
