Thank each evaluator then give 1 min to evaluate the evaluators.

__Andrew__ evaluating __Susan__:  (make something up-- Andrew is addicted to carbon fiber)
__Paul__ evaluating __Uttam__: I am addicted to learning. I can't get enough and if I don't get my daily dose I go through "withdrawals". 
__Abby__ evaluating __Connie__: Abby Ross’s addiction is Toastmasters and she is not in denial. “Toastmaster” is her Word of the Day and no matter where she is as she tells everyone about our amazing organization. If her husband tells her that she talked in her sleep, she asks him how her vocal variety was.
